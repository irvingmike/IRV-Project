|Criteria|Rating/Comments|
|---|---------------|
|**Problem Statement**| **Comments** |
| Does it exist?| Yes |
| Does the problem statement accurately describe project purpose?| Yes |
| Is the problem statement professional? Think of prospective employers viewing this as part of the developer's portfolio. | Yes |
| What is good? | Yes |
| What could be improved? | I think it is really excellent. It does a straight forward job of explaing the need and how it will fill that need. I find it easy to understand and very accessable, even though I would not be target audience. |
| **Design Documentation** ||
| Is the navigation/flow through the application logical and easy to use? | Yes |
| Is the order in which the fields are displayed and form fields entered logical and easy to use? | Yes |
| What data is missing? | For the most part, none. There are some screens that are not fully fleshed out at this time. |
| Is there data that is not used? | No. I actually really like how little data the site collects and still achieves it's goals. |
| What is good? | Simplicity of design. |
| What could be improved? | At this point I think it is going to come down to implimentation. It is an excellent start. |
| **Data model** ||
| Does it exist? | Yes. |
| Is everything on the screens represented in the model? | Yes (and then some) |
| Does the model represent good database design? | I think so, some of the tables on the design show have been removed, but I believe so. |
| What is good? | Yes |
| What could be better? | Maybe a new version of the database design with the current tables? Just for showing to perspective employers. |
